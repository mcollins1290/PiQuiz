In this directory is a .SQL file 'piquiz_dump.sql' which can be used to create the PiQuiz database. All you need to do is to install MariaDB and then issue the following
commands one by one at the Command Prompt:

mysql -u root -p -e "create database piquiz";
mysql piquiz < piquiz_dump.sql -u root -p

You will be prompted for your root password during the execution of both commands.
Once done you will find that the PiQuiz database now exists within your MariaDB instance.
