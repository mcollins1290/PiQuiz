In this directory is a .SQL file 'piquiz_dump.sql' which can be used to create the PiQuiz database. All you need to do is to install MariaDB and then issue the following
command at the Command Prompt:

mysql piquiz < piquiz_dump.sql

Now if you receive a Access Denied error then you will need to provide your MariaDB root password. This can be done by running the below command:

mysql piquiz < piquiz_dump.sql -u root -p

You will be prompted for your root password and once provided MariaDB should create the piquiz database for you.
